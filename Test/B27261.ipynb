    "## Question 1 — Encapsulation in Daily Reality\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encapsulation** is one of the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming that bundles attributes and functions that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. It also restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In daily reality, encapsulation can be compared to a village saving sacco the savings inside are protected from the outside environment, and you can only access them through designed methods. Similarly, in programming, we hide internal implementation details and expose only necessary interfaces.\n",

    "How encapsulation applies in a university management system like Alpha MIS\n",
    "Encapsulation in a system like Alpha MIS helps protect sensitive student and staff information by controlling how data is accessed or modified. For example, student grades, fee balances, or registration details are stored as private attributes and can only be changed through secure methods that enforce validation rules. This ensures data accuracy and prevents unauthorized users from altering academic or financial records. By encapsulating data, the university maintains integrity, privacy, and reliability within its management systems."
